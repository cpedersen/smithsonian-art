His father encouraged him to finish school, however, and promised him fifty dollars a week indefinitely if he would get an advanced degree as an “insurance policy” before devoting his life to painting. Motherwell became friends with many European surrealists in New York and was an active spokesman and writer in support of abstract art. In 1943, Peggy Guggenheim invited him to contribute to a show of collages that included work by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Georges Braque. He had never worked in collage before, but soon discovered that it was a “joy” and returned to it frequently throughout his career. Motherwell was one of the first American artists to experiment with the surrealist automatic approach, by brushing, splashing, and pouring paint onto the canvas without much “critical intervention or editing.” (1977 interview by Barbaralee Diamonstein, in Arnason, <i>Robert Motherwell</i>, 1982)</p>",
